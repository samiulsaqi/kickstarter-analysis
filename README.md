# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

This project is basically a simple analysis of the feasibility of a crowdfunding project being successful or not based on some sample information about kickstarter projects.

### Purpose

The purpose of the analysis is to find out if Louise's kickstarter project  has the chance of being successful, and if so, how.

## Analysis and Challenges

For this project, we did the analysis of outcomes based on launch dates and based on goal amounts. The main challenge here is that these parameters are not the only determinig factor for the project being a success.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

For the first part, an analysis was done on theater projects based on when they were launched. This included plays, musicals and even theater space building. This broke down the projects status based on their launch dates.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

For the second part, an analysis was done on theater plays based on when their goals. This further broke it down into different ranges of goal amounts and calculated the percentage of projects being successful, failed or cancelled.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The main challenge here is the fact that the demographic diversity that is present in the data set. The data set include information for a variety of countries and types of projects, and differentiating between them is really difficult.

## Results

- Based on the launch dates of the theater projects, it can be said that:
    1. Projects launched around May have the most chance of being successful.
    2. Projects launched around the last quarter of the year (Oct-Dec) are more likely to fail.

- Based on the project outcomes based on goals it is highly likely that Louise's project will be successful as the goal amount range (1000 to 4999) has the 2nd highest success rate

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

    The main limitation of this dataset is that this is focused on a specific source of information so there might be other factors that can not be quantified or specified in this dataset.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

    1. Outcomes based on goals based on country
    2. Outcomes based on backers count
